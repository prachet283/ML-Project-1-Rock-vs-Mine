# ML-Project-1-Rock-vs-Mine
This project aims to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset used for this project is the Sonar dataset from the Kaggle

#Overview
The Sonar dataset contains 208 observations of sonar signals bouncing off a metal cylinder (mine) and a roughly cylindrical rock. Each observation is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0, which represent the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.
