# ML-Project-1-Rock-vs-Mine
This project aims to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset used for this project is the Sonar dataset from the Kaggle.

# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies rocks vs. mines using logistic regression.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Rock vs. Mine (sonar) dataset from kaggle. It consists of 208 observations of sonar signals bouncing off different surfaces. Each observation has 60 features representing the energy within a particular frequency band.

# Requirements
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for viewing and running the project)
Google Colab ( preferred )

# Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Rock_vs_Mine_Logistic_Regression.ipynb to see the project code and results.
You can also use the trained model in your own applications.

# Results
The logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 83.42% on the train set.
The logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 76.19% on the test set.
